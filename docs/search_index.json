Children are estimated to consume three-times as much food as adults when compared to their body mass (Signes-Pastor et al., 2017) Several toxic elements crosses the placenta and reach the fetus (Concha et al., 1998; Punshon et al., 2015) 2.4 Inorganic contaminats 2.4.1 Arsenic Arsenic Exposure - Interactive infographic Metals Effects Reference Arsenic Cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Lee et al., 2002; Nizam et al., 2013) Increased preterm birth, toxicological effects on the developing fetus in pregnancy including impaired fetal growth and neonatal deaths during pregnancy (Hopenhayn et al., 2003; Rahman et al., 2016) Neurological and cognitive dysfunction (particularly in children) (Tyler and Allan, 2014) Lung, skin, liver, and bladder cancer (Hubaux et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013; Meliker et al., 2010; Rossman et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2006) Immune system damage (Ferrario et al., 2016) Anemia, skin irritations, and peripheral neuropathy (Rahman et al., 2014) Hypertension (Rahman et al., 1999) 2.4.2 Mercury Unlike arsenic and lead, studies on mercury’s effect on childhood development have largely focused on the impact it may have via maternal exposure during pregnancy. In these instances, prenatal mercury exposure has consistently been found to be associated with poor neurodevelopment and lowered IQ (Jacobson et al., 2015). Metals Effects Reference Mercury Nervous system disorders (loss of memory, sensorimotor polyneuropathy, hallucinations, neurodegenerative diseases in adults such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases) (Carocci et al., 2014; Counter and Buchanan, 2004; Weiss et al., 2002) Enzyme, immune, and genetic disorders (Andreoli and Sprovieri, 2017; Engwa et al., 2019) Minamata disease in Japan and poisoning in Iraq (Gochfeld, 2003) Fever, malaise, hallucinations, delusions, gingivitis, and cough (WHO, 1991) Weight loss, insomnia, erythema, and renal tubular dysfunction (Weldon et al., 2000) 2.4.3 Lead Similar to inorganic arsenic, lead exposure has been associated with a number of poor health outcomes including decreased cognitive performance, behavioral problems, delayed puberty and stunted postnatal growth. Most concerning is that the cognitive effects that lead exposure in early childhood contributes to appear to be permanent. In one follow-up prospective study, individuals who had previously experienced lead-associated developmental delays in childhood continued to show persistent cognitive deficits into adulthood (Mazumdar et al., 2011). Metals Effects Reference Lead Decreased fertility in men (Apostoli et al., 2000) Gastrointestinal diseases, kidney and brain damage (ATSDR, 1999) Reproductive toxicity and adverse effects on fetal development (Levin and Goldberg, 2000; Odongo et al., 2016) Bladder and lung cancer (IARC, 1994) Cognitive dysfunction, neurological disorders, and hypertension (Patrick, 2006) Renal tumors, fatigue, weight loss, and headache (Hubbs-Tait et al., 2005) Oxidative DNA damage (Hsu and Guo, 2002) 2.4.4 Cadmium Following suit with arsenic, lead, and mercury, cadmium exposure in infancy and young childhood has been found to negatively affect Full Scale IQ scores (Sanders et al., 2015). Cadmium exposure has also been found to be linked to increased incidence of Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (Lee et al., 2018). Metals Effects Reference Cadmium Kidney damage (Jin et al., 2002) Neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer’s disease) (Jiang et al., 2007) Carcinogenic to humans (classified in group 1), causing breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer (Nagata et al., 2005; Waalkes, 2003) Itai-itai disease in Japan (osteoporosis, anemia, renal tubular dysfunction) (Horiguchi et al., 1994; Ogawa et al., 2004) Lung edema, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and vomiting (Nordberg, 2004; Seidal et al., 1993) Cardiovascular disease (Gallagher and Meliker, 2010) Renal dysfunction (Järup, 2002) Royal Society of Chemistry 2.5 References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
