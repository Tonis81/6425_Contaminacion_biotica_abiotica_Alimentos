Signes-Pastor Chapter 1 Risk 1.1 Risk analysis Risk analysis is internationally accepted as a key component to support decision-making around food safety. Risk analysis has been defined by Codex Alimentarius Commission as a process consisting of three components: i) risk assessment, ii) risk management and iii) risk communication: (WHO-FAO, 2009): Figure 1: Risk analysis Risk assessment: A scientifically based process consisting of the following steps: Hazard identification, Hazard characterization, Exposure assessment, and Risk characterization. Risk assessment is undertaken by joint FAO/WHO, EFSA, ATSDR, … Risk management: The process, distinct from risk assessment, of weighing policy alternatives, in consultation with all interested parties, considering risk assessment and other factors relevant for the health protection of consumers and for the promotion of fair trade practices and, if needed, selecting appropriate prevention and control options. Risk management is undertaken by the Codex Alimentarius Commission … Risk communication: The interactive exchange of information and opinions throughout the risk analysis process concerning risk, risk-related factors and risk perceptions, among risk assessors, risk managers, consumers, industry, the academic community and other interested parties, including the explanation of risk assessment findings and the basis of risk management decisions. 1.1.1 Hazard A biological, chemical, or physical agent in, or condition of, food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect (Codex Alimentarius, 1999; Parliament and Council, 2002). Inherent property of an agent or situation having the potential to cause adverse effects when an organism, system or (sub)population is exposed to that agent.

harm. Or, another way of looking at it is to consider risk an estimate of the probability of a hazard being present. Risk is the probability of an adverse effect in an organism, system or (sub)population caused under specified circumstances by exposure to an agent. Risk means a function of the probability of an adverse health effect and the severity of that effect, consequential to a hazard (Parliament and Council, 2002) 1.1.3 Hazard vs. Risk 1.1.4 Risk ranking The categorisation of a risk can be done by combining the likelihood of occurrence in a matrix with the severity of the consequence. Risk ranking is a technique that can be used to indentify the most significant risks, thereby prioritising them in a given situation to enable efficient and effective management decision making (FAO, 2020). Figure 3: Risk ranking 1.2 Risk assessment Figure 4: Risk assessment Risk assessment is the central scientific component of risk analysis and was developed primarily because of the need to make decisions to protect health in the face of scientific uncertainty. Risk assessment of food chemicals can be generally described as characterizing the potential hazards and the associated risks to life and health resulting from exposure of humans to chemicals present in food over a specified period. Risk assessment is the key part of risk analysis that helps make decisions about human health protection from exposure to hazardous chemicals. Risk assessment is an activity that provides a crucial link between regulatory and public health policy decision making. It offers a highly systematic framework within which information can be organized and evaluated to serve the practical needs of decision makers. It provides information on what can and cannot be learned from the available research about threats to human health. According to the FAO/WHO, risk assessment is divided into four steps: hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment, and risk characterization. What is the probability (preferably expressed quantitatively) that adverse health effects will occur in individuals exposed to an agent (whether it is a chemical, biological, or physical agent) or activity? See EFSA: The four steps of risk assessment 1.2.1 Hazard identification The purpose of food chemical hazard identification is to evaluate the weight of evidence for adverse health effects, based on assessment of all available data on toxicity and mode of action. It is designed to primarily address two questions: 1) the nature of any health hazard to humans that an agent may pose and 2) the circumstances under which an identified hazard may be expressed. Hazard identification is based on analyses of a variety of data, ranging from observations in humans or domestic animals and studies in laboratory animals and in vitro laboratory studies through to analysis of structure–activity relationships. From the range of studies and observations available, the nature of any toxicity or adverse health effects occurring and the affected target organs or target tissues are identified. An adverse effect is described by the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) as “Change in morphology, physiology, growth, reproduction, development, or lifespan of an organism which results in impairment of functional capacity or impairment of capacity to compensate for additional stress or increased susceptibility to the harmful effects of other environmental influences.” (control, 2020) It is important to stress that regardless of the use situation, the intrinsic hazard of the chemical is the same and thus the hazard assessment from one country can be of use in another country. 1.2.2 Hazard characterization Hazard characterization is the second stage in the process of hazard assessment and the second of four steps in risk assessment. The qualitative and, wherever possible, quantitative description of the inherent properties of an agent or situation having the potential to cause adverse effects. This should, where possible, include a dose–response assessment and its attendant uncertainties. Hazard characterization describes the relationship between the administered dose, or exposure to, a chemical and the incidence of an adverse health effect. The critical effect—that is, the first adverse effect observed as the dose or exposure is increased—is determined. In cases where the toxic effect is assumed to have a threshold, hazard characterization usually results in the establishment of health-based guidance values—for example, an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for additives or residues or a tolerable intake (TI) for contaminants. Figure 5: Dose-response functions and 95% confidence bands. Metal concentrations and anthropometric indicators of 6–11-year-old children from the 2013 to 2016 NHANES (Signes-Pastor et al., 2021a). Figure 6: Illustration of non-threshold (circles) and threshold (stars) dose-response relationships (control, 2020). 1.2.3 Exposure assessement Exposure assessment is the third step in the process of risk assessment. Exposure depends on conditions that may vary between countries or, more likely, at a local level Exposure assessment is defined as follows: “Evaluation of the exposure of an organism, system, or (sub)population to an agent (and its derivatives). The exposure assessment of food chemicals may be described more narrowly as “The qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the likely intake of chemical agents via food as well as exposure from other sources if relevant”. In the case of food chemicals, dietary exposure assessment takes into consideration the occurrence and concentrations of the chemical The exposure assessment takes into account the consumption patterns of the foods containing the chemical and the likelihood of consumers eating large amounts of the foods in question (high consumers) and of the chemical being present in these foods at high levels. Usually a range of intake or exposure estimates will be provided (e.g. for average consumers and for high consumers), and estimates may be broken down by subgroup of the population (e.g. infants, children, adults). Figure 7: Schematic illustration of exposure, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of chemicals (control, 2020). Toxicokinetics: What the body do with the chemical? Absorption; Distribution; Metabolism; Excretion. Toxicodynamics: What does the chemical do to the body? Interaction between a substance and the body that result in a toxic effect. Agregate exposure: combined exposures to a single stressor across multiple routes and multiple pathways. See EPA ExpoBox Cumulative exposure: combined exposure to multiple stressors via multiple exposure pathways that affect single biological target. See EPA ExpoBox 1.2.4 Risk characterization Risk characterization is final step of the risk assessment process. Risk characterisation combines the results of hazard identification and dose-response assessment with exposure assessment. The qualitative and, wherever possible, quantitative determination, including attendant uncertainties, of the probability of occurrence of known and potential adverse effects of an agent in a given organism, system, or (sub)- population, under defined exposure conditions. In risk characterization, the information from the intake or exposure assessment and the hazard characterization is integrated into advice suitable for decision-making in risk management. Risk characterization provides estimates of the potential risk to human health under different exposure scenarios. It should include all key assumptions and describe the nature, relevance and magnitude of any risks to human health. The risk characterization statement should include a clear explanation of any uncertainties in the risk assessment resulting from gaps in the science base. It should also include, where relevant, information on susceptible subpopulations, including those with greater potential exposure or specific predisposing physiological conditions or genetic factors. The advice to risk managers can be in the form of a comparison of the relative risks among risk management options. The health risk characterisation can be described as follows: *Risk unacceptable: Exposure/reference value ≥ 1* *Risk acceptable: Exposure/reference value &lt;1* 1.3 Approach Generally, two approaches can be followed to assess risk (Devleesschauwer et al., 2018; FAO, 2020) 1.4 Example risk assessment EFSA explains risk assessment: Caffeine Scientific Opinion on the safety of caffeine 1.5 References "],["metals.html", "Chapter 2 Metals 2.1 WHO - chemicals of public health concern 2.2 ATSDR’s Subtance Priority list 2.3 Vulnerable subpopulations 2.4 Inorganic contaminats 2.5 References", " Chapter 2 Metals 2.1 WHO - chemicals of public health concern WHO. 10 Chemicals of public health concern 2.2 ATSDR’s Subtance Priority list Agency for Toxic Substancies and Disease Register 2.3 Vulnerable subpopulations Infants and young children are especially vulnerable to the toxic elements due to their immature development and high ‘food intake/ body weight’ ratio (Bair, 2022; de Paiva et al., 2019). Children are estimated to consume three-times as much food as adults when compared to their body mass (Signes-Pastor et al., 2017b) Several toxic elements crosses the placenta and reach the fetus (Concha et al., 1998; Punshon et al., 2015) 2.4 Inorganic contaminats 2.4.1 Arsenic Arsenic Exposure - Interactive infographic Metals Effects Reference Arsenic Cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Lee et al., 2002; Nizam et al., 2013) Increased preterm birth, toxicological effects on the developing fetus in pregnancy including impaired fetal growth and neonatal deaths during pregnancy (Hopenhayn et al., 2003; Rahman et al., 2016) Neurological and cognitive dysfunction (particularly in children) (Tyler and Allan, 2014) Lung, skin, liver, and bladder cancer (Hubaux et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013; Meliker et al., 2010; Rossman et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2006) Immune system damage (Ferrario et al., 2016) Anemia, skin irritations, and peripheral neuropathy (Rahman et al., 2014) Hypertension (Rahman et al., 1999) 2.4.2 Mercury Unlike arsenic and lead, studies on mercury’s effect on childhood development have largely focused on the impact it may have via maternal exposure during pregnancy. In these instances, prenatal mercury exposure has consistently been found to be associated with poor neurodevelopment and lowered IQ (Jacobson et al., 2015). Metals Effects Reference Mercury Nervous system disorders (loss of memory, sensorimotor polyneuropathy, hallucinations, neurodegenerative diseases in adults such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases) (Carocci et al., 2014; Counter and Buchanan, 2004; Weiss et al., 2002) Enzyme, immune, and genetic disorders (Andreoli and Sprovieri, 2017; Engwa et al., 2019) Minamata disease in Japan and poisoning in Iraq (Gochfeld, 2003) Fever, malaise, hallucinations, delusions, gingivitis, and cough (WHO, 1991) Weight loss, insomnia, erythema, and renal tubular dysfunction (Weldon et al., 2000) 2.4.3 Lead Similar to inorganic arsenic, lead exposure has been associated with a number of poor health outcomes including decreased cognitive performance, behavioral problems, delayed puberty and stunted postnatal growth. Most concerning is that the cognitive effects that lead exposure in early childhood contributes to appear to be permanent. In one follow-up prospective study, individuals who had previously experienced lead-associated developmental delays in childhood continued to show persistent cognitive deficits into adulthood (Mazumdar et al., 2011). Metals Effects Reference Lead Decreased fertility in men (Apostoli et al., 2000) Gastrointestinal diseases, kidney and brain damage (ATSDR, 1999) Reproductive toxicity and adverse effects on fetal development (Levin and Goldberg, 2000; Odongo et al., 2016) Bladder and lung cancer (IARC, 1994) Cognitive dysfunction, neurological disorders, and hypertension (Patrick, 2006) Renal tumors, fatigue, weight loss, and headache (Hubbs-Tait et al., 2005) Oxidative DNA damage (Hsu and Guo, 2002) 2.4.4 Cadmium Following suit with arsenic, lead, and mercury, cadmium exposure in infancy and young childhood has been found to negatively affect Full Scale IQ scores (Sanders et al., 2015). Cadmium exposure has also been found to be linked to increased incidence of Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (Lee et al., 2018).

Instead, they are readily absorbed by sediments and biomagnified through the food chain (de Paiva et al., 2019). 3.1.1 Vegetables - Arsenic Figure 1: Arsenic concentrations in vegetables from West Bengal India (Signes-Pastor et al., 2008d). 3.1.2 Rice - Arsenic Cultivation in fooded paddy fields - inorganic arsenic mobilization (Signes-Pastor et al., 2007). Arsenic in taken up by the rice plants through pathways for nutrients: Arsenite through silicon pathway – highly efficient in rice plant. Arsenate through phosphate transporter. Brown rice generally contains higher arsenic concentrations than polished/white rice. Rice bran (Pericarp &amp; Aleurone) extremely high iAs content. Superfood, popular ingredient in health-added products and high nutritional content. 3.2 Rice products - Arsenic Figure 2: Inorganic arsenic concentrations in rice-based products from the UK market (Signes-Pastor et al., 2016) 3.2.1 FDA Infant Rice Cereals Inorganic Arsenic FDA Makes Available Results from Testing of Infant Rice Cereal for Inorganic Arsenic (tested in 2018) 3.2.2 Legislation Table 1: Proposed and existing inorganic arsenic, lead standards Metal Group.or.agency Standard Inorganic arsenic Healthy Babies Bright Futures No measurable amount in baby foods Consumer Reports 3 ppb FDA 10 ppb for bottled water 100 ppb in infant rice cereal EPA, EU, WHO 10 ppb for drinking water EC 100 ppb (for infant/ child foods) 200 ppb (for adult foods) Lead Environmental Defense Fund 1 ppb (especially for baby foods) Consumer Reports 1 ppb in fruit juices American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 1 ppb for water fountains in schools FDA 5 ppb for bottled water 50 ppb for juice 100 ppb for candy WHO 10 ppb provisional guideline EPA 15 ppb for drinking water (action level) EU 20 ppb for infant formula and follow-on formula Cadmium Healthy Babies Bright Futures No measurable amount in baby foods Consumer Reports 1 ppb in all fruit juices WHO 3 ppb for drinking water EPA/ FDA 5 ppb for drinking water EU 5-20 ppb for infant formula Mercury Healthy Babies Bright Futures No measurable amount in baby foods EPA 2 ppb for drinking water EC, European Commission; EPA, Environmental Protection Agency; EU, European Union; FDA, Food and Drug Administration; ppb, parts per billion; WHO, World Health Organization.

Increase presence of mixed multi-grain products and mueslis for infants (Carey et al., 2018; Signes-Pastor et al., 2017b, 2017a). Is Homemade Baby Food Better? 3.8 Oportunities and Challages for Dietary Arsenic Intervention Our greatest success in reducing arsenic dietary exposures can be achieved only by a multisector, multiagency, science-informed, public health systems approach coordinated across regulators and the industry (Nachman et al., 2018). 3.8.1 Closer to Zero: Action Plan for Baby Foods Closer to Zero 3.9 References "],["top-down-approach.html", "Chapter 4 Top-down Approach 4.1 Epidemiology 4.2 Diet assessement 4.3 Inorganic Arsenic metabolism 4.4 Effect of weaning on metals exposure 4.5 Arsenic exposure and neurodevelopment 4.6 Respiratory outcomes 4.7 Mixture 4.8 References", " Chapter 4 Top-down Approach 4.1 Epidemiology Epidemiology is the study of the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease (and healthcare) in populations (Epidemiology, 2016). Epidemiology has been defined as ‘the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why’. It is concerned not only with the distribution of disease within a particular group or population, but also with the causes of disease. Epidemiologists are in many ways disease detectives, tracking down disease to discover why it occurs as well as when and where it occurs (Epidemiology, 2016). Here is the classic form of an epidemiologic question: “What is the relationship between this exposure and that outcome?”(Epidemiology, 2016) Epidemiology is particularly interested in the patterns of disease distribution in human populations. In particular, it aims to discover who develops health problems, when they contract illness and in which locations a problem is particularly prevalent (Epidemiology, 2016). 4.1.1 Types of epidemiology studies Epidemiological studies generally fall into four broad categories (Epidemiology, 2016): Cross-sectional studies Case-control studies Cohort studies Intervention studies. Cross-Sectional: In cross-sectional studies a single set of assessments is made on a group of participants. These might be life style habits (e.g., diet, alcohol use), disease status (e.g., diabetic or not) or medical measurements (e.g., diastolic blood pressure). Cross-sectional studies measure the prevalence of conditions or characteristics of people in a population at a point in time or over a short period . Prevalence is the total number of people suffering from a specific disease at a certain point in time. The point prevalence rate per 1000 population = the number of existing cases of the disease in the population at a specific moment in time / the population at risk at that specific time; for example, June 2000. Case-Control Study: In case-control studies, participants are selected according to whether or not they have experienced the outcome (often the “disease”) under study. These focus on determining disease causation. The ‘case’ is a person who has a particular symptom or medical condition. Thus, the focus is on a group of cases which is then compared with a ‘control group’ consisting of persons not having the symptom or the medical condition (example (Signes-Pastor et al., 2019b)). Cohort Study: A cohort is a group of participants followed over time. If there is formal follow-up of individuals over time, the study is often referred to as a cohort (or follow-up) study. Example of cohort studies include “INfancia y Medio Ambiente” (INMA) in Spain, and the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS) in the US. Intervention studies: They involve intervening with a group of people, and include an equivalent group which acts as a ‘control’. The most popular study of this kind is the randomised controlled trial (RCT). In RCT the investigators determine the exposures (i.e., treatment) for the patients. 4.1.1.1 INMA - INfancia y Medio Ambiente Prospective cohort study - 7 subcohorts (prior: Ribera d’Ebre, Menorca, and Granada; new: Asturias, Gipuzkoa, Sabadell, and Valencia) - web. Evaluate prenatal and early-life exposure to environmental pollutants. Gathered information Mothers Children Socio economic characteristics Diet and physical activity Labor characteristics Anthropometry Smoking habit Respiratory symptoms Diet Cognitive assessment Biological samples (blood, placenta, urine, saliva, hair, nails, and breast milk) Biological samples: blood, urine, saliva, hair and nails Dietary and environmental blood biomarkers 4.1.1.2 NHBCS - New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study NHBCS &amp; Dartmouth College In Small Doses: Arsenic 4.1.2 Other cohort studies 4.1.2.1 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) NHANES 4.1.2.2 Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) ECHO (Buckley et al., 2020) 4.2 Diet assessement Food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) 3-day diaries 4.3 Inorganic Arsenic metabolism Propose metabolic pathways for the conversion of inorganic arsenic into organic arsenic (Mochizuki, 2019) The inorganic arsenic metabolism is a multistep process catalized by the enzime arsenic-3-metiltransferase (AS3MT), and the S-adenosylmetionine as methyl group donor. Figure 1: Inorganic arsenic metabolism 4.3.1 Biomarkers Biomarker Advatages Disadvantages Blood Marker of short-term internal exposure. Difficult matrix to work with. Suitable to evaluate early biological effects (DNA damage or oxidative stress). Invasive sampling. Hair &amp; nails Maker of long-term internal exposure. Limited knowledge of the different As species that accumulate in hair and nails. Non-invasive sampling. Susceptible to external contamination (e.g. shampoos, nail polish, etc.). Easy transport and conservation. Marker of in utero exposure (Infant toenails). Urine Marker of short-term internal exposure. Potential cofounders (e.g. sex, age, seafood consumption, etc.) Non-invasive sampling. Spot urine samples reliability in urinary dilution adjustment. Urinary As speciation - human body methylation capacity. Difficult 24-h urine collection.

The colors from yellow to red refer to the log-transformed median toenail arsenic concentrations calculated using the overall mean/median value reported in the included studies (Signes-Pastor et al., 2021b). Figure 3: Arsenic concentrations (arithmetic mean or median, μg/g) in human toenails (1993–2017). The green circles and red crosses refer to the minimum and maximum values of toenail arsenic in population subgroups assessed in the reviewed study. The empty rhombus refers to the overall value of toenail arsenic reported in the reviewed study. The number within brackets refers to the overall size of the study population, and when this information is not available (n.a.). Noticed that the range of the x-axis in the arithmethic mean and median differ to help visualization. The studies are sorted by country, year, and first author’s name. UK = United Kingdom; USA = United States of America (Signes-Pastor et al., 2021b). Drinking water, occupational exposure, and living in industrial areas associated with an increased toenail arsenic concentrations. Toenail arsenic concentration is an adequate measure to evaluate chronic diseases Other elements in toenails (Gutiérrez-González et al., 2019; Salcedo-Bellido et al., 2021) 4.4 Effect of weaning on metals exposure 4.4.1 Methods NHBCS; n = 15 pairs (pre-weaning at 4 months and post-weaning at 6 months of age). 3-day food diary. 4.4.2 Results Figure 4: Concentrations of urinary arsenic species before (at 4 months of age) and during weaning (at 6 months of age) to solid foods. At 6 months of age infants’ diets included solid food in addition to breast milk, formula, or a mixture of both breast milk and formula. Each infant is identified by a unique color to facilitate the comparison between the two time points. Figure 5: Concentrations of infant urinary arsenic species in relation to intake of specific foods at 6 months of age. Each infant is identified by a unique color. Spearman’s correlation coefficient and p-value for each dietary item. Urinary arsenic species concentration and solid food consumption were natural logarithm transformed to help visualization. The least-squares regression line is also included to help visualize associations. *Infant P14 was not included in Spearman’s correlation between urinary arsenic species content and the formula powder intake level (outlier). 4.5 Arsenic exposure and neurodevelopment (Signes-Pastor et al., 2019c) 4.5.1 Methods 400 children 4-5 years. 100 children evenly distributed between boys and girls from each sub-cohort of Asturias, Gipuzkoa, Sabadell, and Valencia. Median water As &lt; 1 µg/L. Spot urine samples. uAs speciation. iAs exposure = ΣiAs + MMA + DMA Children’s neurodevelopment - standardized version of the McCarthy Scales of Children’s Ability (MSCA). MSCA test includes a battery of 18 subtests (i.e. construction with cubes, puzzle, pictorial memory, vocabulary, calculation, beating sequence, verbal memory, right-left orientation, leg coordination, arm coordination, imitative action, copying of drawings, drawing of a child, numerical memory, verbal fluency, counting and distribution, opposites, and concept formation) (Julvez et al., 2011). Multiple linear models adjusted for confounders (Directed acyclic graph): ﻿maternal highest attained level of education (i.e. primary, secondary, or university), and children’s sex (i.e. girls or boys), BMI (kg/m2), age at MSCA (years) and calorie adjusted consumption of rice and fish/seafood products (g/day). 4.5.2 Results Table 1: Association between children’s ln sum of urinary As concentrations and MSCA scores (sex-combined) For each interquartile range increase in exposure, we found a decrease of over 2 points in the scores for global motor and gross motor scores, and 1.5 points in the scores for the fine motor function. Table 2: Association between children’s ln sum of urinary As concentrations and MSCA scores according to sex For each interquartile range increase in exposure we found a decrease of 2.6 points in the scores for the quantitative index and working memory among boys. Inorganic As exposure, even at relatively low levels from diet, may affect negatively the scores in the original global motor function the derived gross motor function and fine motor function. Boys may be more susceptible to iAs neurotoxicity compared to girls particularly from cognitive tasks related to numerical function, and temporarily storing and managing information Cross-sectional design of the study that precludes us from determining temporality and thus limits any inferences about causality. Effect of unknown factors such as other environmental/dietary factors or residual confounding remains a possibility. Relatively small size of the study population, especially in sex-stratified analyses. 4.6 Respiratory outcomes (Signes-Pastor et al., 2021c) 4.7 Mixture (Signes-Pastor et al., 2019a) 4.8 References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
