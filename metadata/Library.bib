	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe demographic characteristics, patterns of use, and symptoms associated with mercury poisoning among persons who used a Mexican beauty cream containing mercurous chloride and to estimate the prevalence of cream use in Texas near the Mexico border. DESIGN: Case series and cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Border communities of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas. PARTICIPANTS: Persons who used the cream and contacted a health department in response to announcements about the cream and households that participated in the Survey of Health and Environmental Conditions in Texas Border Counties and Colonias, 1997. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Urine mercury concentrations, self-reported symptoms, and prevalence of cream use among households. RESULTS: Of 330 cream users who contacted their health department, 96% were women, and 95% were Hispanic. The mean urine mercury concentration was 146.7 microg/L (reference range : 0-20 microg/L). In 5% of 2,194 randomly selected Texas households near the Mexico border, at least 1 person had used "Crema de Belleza-Manning" (Laboratorios Vida Natural, S.A., Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico) in the previous year. CONCLUSIONS: Most cream users had increased urine mercury concentrations. Cream use was common in Texas near the Mexico border. Physicians should consider toxicity in patients with neurologic symptoms of unclear cause and use public health departments when investigating unusual illnesses.},

@article{Weiss2002wd,
	abstract = {This article discusses three examples of delay (latency) in the appearance of signs and symptoms of poisoning after exposure to methylmercury. First, a case is presented of a 150-day delay period before the clinical manifestations of brain damage after a single brief (<1 day) exposure to dimethylmercury. The second example is taken from the Iraq outbreak of methylmercury poisoning in which the victims consumed contaminated bread for several weeks without any ill effects. Indeed, signs of poisoning did not appear until weeks or months after exposure stopped. The last example is drawn from observations on nonhuman primates and from the sequelae of the Minamata, Japan, outbreak in which low chronic doses of methylmercury may not have produced observable behavioral effects for periods of time measured in years. The mechanisms of these latency periods are discussed for both acute and chronic exposures. Parallels are drawn with other diseases that affect the central nervous system, such as Parkinson disease and post-polio syndrome, that also reflect the delayed appearance of central nervous system damage.},

@article{Waalkes2003ti,
	abstract = {Cadmium is a heavy metal of considerable environmental and occupational concern. Cadmium compounds are classified as human carcinogens by several regulatory agencies. The most convincing data that cadmium is carcinogenic in humans comes from studies indicating occupational cadmium exposure is associated with lung cancer. Cadmium exposure has also been linked to human prostate and renal cancer, although this linkage is weaker than for lung cancer. Other target sites of cadmium carcinogenesis in humans, such as liver, pancreas and stomach, are considered equivocal. In animals, cadmium effectively induces cancers at multiple sites and by various routes. Cadmium inhalation in rats induces pulmonary adenocarcinomas, in accord with its role in human lung cancer. Cadmium can induce tumors and/or preneoplastic lesions within the rat prostate after ingestion or injection. At relatively high doses, cadmium induces benign testicular tumors in rats, but these appear to be due to early toxic lesions and loss of testicular function, rather than from a specific carcinogenic effect of cadmium. Like many other metals, cadmium salts will induce mesenchymal tumors at the site of subcutaneous (s.c.) or intramuscular (i.m.) injections, but the human relevance of these is dubious. Other targets of cadmium in rodents include the liver, adrenal, pancreas, pituitary, and hematopoietic system. With the exception of testicular tumors in rodents, the mechanisms of cadmium carcinogenesis are poorly defined. Cadmium can cause any number of molecular lesions that would be relevant to oncogenesis in various cellular model systems. Most studies indicate cadmium is poorly mutagenic and probably acts through indirect or epigenetic mechanisms, potentially including aberrant activation of oncogenes and suppression of apoptosis.},

	abstract = {Arsenic toxicity is a worldwide health concern as several millions of people are exposed to this toxicant via drinking water, and exposure affects almost every organ system in the body including the brain. Recent studies have shown that even low concentrations of arsenic impair neurological function, particularly in children. This review will focus on the current epidemiological evidence of arsenic neurotoxicity in children and adults, with emphasis on cognitive dysfunction, including learning and memory deficits and mood disorders. We provide a cohesive synthesis of the animal studies that have focused on neural mechanisms of dysfunction after arsenic exposure including altered epigenetics; hippocampal function; glucocorticoid and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) pathway signaling; glutamatergic, cholinergic and monoaminergic signaling; adult neurogenesis; and increased Alzheimer's-associated pathologies. Finally, we briefly discuss new studies focusing on therapeutic strategies to combat arsenic toxicity including the use of selenium and zinc.},

@article{Smith2006,
	abstract = {Arsenic in drinking water is an established cause of lung cancer, and preliminary evidence suggests that ingested arsenic may also cause nonmalignant lung disease. Antofagasta is the second largest city in Chile and had a distinct period of very high arsenic exposure that began in 1958 and lasted 1971, when an arsenic removal plant was installed. This unique exposure scenario provides a rare opportunity to investigate the long-term mortality impact of early-life arsenic exposure. In this study, we compared mortality rates in Antofagasta in the period 1989-2000 with those of the rest of Chile, focusing on subjects who were born during or just before the peak exposure period and who were 30-49 years of age at the time of death. For the birth cohort born just before the high-exposure period (1950-1957) and exposed in early childhood, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for lung cancer was 7.0 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 5.4-8.9; p {\textless} 0.001] and the SMR for bronchiectasis was 12.4 (95{\%} CI, 3.3-31.7; p {\textless} 0.001). For those born during the high-exposure period (1958-1970) with probable exposure in utero and early childhood, the corresponding, SMR were 6.1 (95{\%} CI, 3.5-9.9; p {\textless} 0.001) for lung cancer and 46.2 (95{\%} CI, 21.1-87.7; p {\textless} 0.001) for bronchiectasis. These findings suggest that exposure to arsenic in drinking water during early childhood or in utero has pronounced pulmonary effects, greatly increasing subsequent mortality in young adults from both malignant and nonmalignant lung disease.},

Early childhood inorganic arsenic (i-As) exposure is of particular concern since it may adversely impact on lifetime health outcomes. Infants' urinary arsenic (As) metabolites were analysed in 79 infants by inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometric detection (ICICP- MS) to evaluate i-As exposure pre-And post-weaning. Levels of i-As in rice-based weaning and infants' foods were also determined to relate to urinary As levels. Higher As levels, especially of monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), were found in urine from formula fed infants compared to those breastfed. Urine from infants post-weaning consuming rice-products resulted in higher urinary MMA and DMA compared to the paired pre-weaning urine samples. The European Union (EU) has regulated i-As in rice since 1st January 2016. Comparing infants' rice-based foods before and after this date, little change was found. Nearly of the rice-based products specifically marketed for infants and young children contained i-As over the 0.1 mg/kg EU limit. Efforts should be made to provide low i-As rice and rice-based products consumed by infants and young children that do not exceed the maximum i-As level to protect this vulnerable subpopulation.},

	abstract = {Lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) neurotoxicity is well established. In recent years, a growing body of evidence suggests that environmental exposure to other metals including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and manganese (Mn) and their mixtures also poses public health threats. In this paper, we summarize the recent literature examining the relationship of prenatal and childhood environmental metal exposures with cognitive and behavioral outcomes in children. We conducted a literature search to identify epidemiologic studies that examined the relationship of Cd, Mn, and metal mixtures with children's neurodevelopmental/cognitive and behavioral outcomes. We restricted the search to peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 2009 and March 2015. We identified a total of 31 articles of which 16, 17, and 16 studies examined the effects of Cd, Mn, or metal mixtures, respectively. Based on our review, there is suggestive evidence that prenatal/childhood Cd exposure may be associated with poorer cognition, but additional research is clearly needed. We found little evidence of behavioral effects of early life Cd exposure, and no studies found a significant relationship with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Studies of early life Mn exposure consistently reported negative impacts on both cognition and behavior. There is also growing evidence that co-exposure to multiple metals can result in increased neurotoxicity compared to single-metal exposure, in particular during early life. Few studies have evaluated behavioral effects related to metal co-exposure.},

	abstract = {Inorganic arsenic (arsenite and arsenate) in drinking water has been associated with skin cancers in several countries such as Taiwan, Chile, Argentina, Bangladesh, and Mexico. This association has not been established in the United States. In addition, inorganic arsenic alone in drinking water does not cause skin cancers in animals. We recently showed that concentrations as low as 1.25 mg/l sodium arsenite were able to enhance the tumorigenicity of solar UV irradiation in mice. The tumors were almost all squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). These data suggest that arsenic in drinking water may need a carcinogenic partner, such as sunlight, in the induction of skin cancers. Arsenite may enhance tumorigenicity via effects on DNA repair and DNA damage-induced cell cycle effects, leading to genomic instability. Others have found that dimethlyarsinic acid (DMA), a metabolite of arsenite, can induce bladder cancers at high concentrations in drinking water. In those experiments, skin cancers were not produced. Taken together, these data suggest that arsenite (or possibly an earlier metabolite), and not DMA, is responsible for the skin cancers, but a second genotoxic agent may be a requirement. The differences between the US and the other arsenic-exposed populations with regard to skin cancers might be explained by the lower levels of arsenic in the US, less sun exposure, better nutrition, or perhaps genetic susceptibility differences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endocrine-related adverse health effects from exposure to heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury are yet to be adequately described. The purpose of this review was to gain insight into maternal exposure to heavy metals, and to identify potential endocrine-related adverse health effects in the mother and the infant. METHODS: Relevant databases were searched for original research reports and a total of 46 articles were retained for scrutiny. Required data was extracted from these studies and their methodology was assessed. RESULTS: Impaired fetal growth was observed from exposure to all endocrine disrupting metals, while exposure to lead and arsenic were associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and neonatal deaths. Maternal exposure to arsenic was associated with impaired glucose tolerance in these mothers. CONCLUSION: Impaired fetal growth, fetal loss, and neonatal deaths were significantly associated with heavy metals exposure during pregnancy; however, hypertension and gestational diabetes require further investigation.},

	abstract = {Dopamine-Œ≤-hydroxylase (DBH) is a neurotransmitter (catecholamine)-mediating enzyme, which catalyzes the formation of norepinephrine from dopamine. The levels of DBH activity, its coenzyme (ascorbic acid) and cofactor (Cu(++)) and other biochemical parameters were measured in the serum of 32 arsenicosis patients of Bangladesh at three different age groups, namely, group 1 (10-18 years, 9 patients), group 2 (19-40 years, 14 patients) and group 3 (41-70 years, 9 patients) of the locality of Stadium Para of Meherpur district of Bangladesh. The values were compared with the same number of age-matched normal healthy individuals of the respective group. DBH activity was markedly decreased in the patients of group 1 as compared to that of the normal healthy people. The activities of DBH were decreased to lesser extents for the other two age groups. The total protein contents in the serum of arsenicosis patients were also significantly low as compared to that in the age-matched control groups. The levels of ascorbic acid and copper were found to be decreased in the serum of arsenicosis patients. The serum glucose levels were elevated in arsenicosis patients, as compared to that of the respective healthy controls. Other parameters, such as zinc and vitamin A levels were also decreased in the serum of arsenicosis patients. It was evident from the results of drinking of the arsenic contaminated water of shallow tube wells that the levels of DBH activity decreased significantly as compared to the control healthy persons. The levels of proteins, ascorbic acid, copper, zinc and vitamin A were decreased in the serum of people drinking the arsenic contaminated tube wells water as compared to that in the control healthy people with the exception that the levels of glucose were elevated in the serum of these patients. The pathophysiological significance of the results could be correlated with the decreased in proteins and that in DBH activities as DBH deficiency is characterized by lack of sympathetic noradrenergic function.The general physiologic findings of autonomic function indicate that complete DBH deficiency include minimal or absent plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine.},

	abstract = {-A prevalence comparison of hypertension among subjects with and those without arsenic exposure through drinking water was conducted in Bangladesh to confirm or refute an earlier observation of a relation in this respect. Wells with and without present arsenic contamination were identified, and we interviewed and examined 1595 subjects who were depending on drinking water from these wells for living, all >/=30 years of age. The interview was based on a questionnaire, and arsenic exposure was estimated from the history of well-water consumption and current arsenic levels. Of the 1595 subjects studied, 1481 had a history of arsenic-contaminated drinking water, whereas 114 had not. Time-weighted mean arsenic levels (in milligrams per liter) and milligram-years per liter of arsenic exposure were estimated for each subject. Exposure categories were assessed as <0.5 mg/L, 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L, and >1.0 mg/L and alternatively as <1.0 mg-y/L, 1.0 to 5.0 mg-y/L, >5.0 but </=10.0 mg-y/L, and >10.0 mg-y/L, respectively. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of >/=140 mm Hg in combination with a diastolic blood pressure of >/=90 mm Hg. Corresponding to the exposure categories, and using "unexposed" as the reference, the prevalence ratios for hypertension adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index were 1.2, 2.2, 2.5 and 0.8, 1.5, 2.2, 3.0, in relation to arsenic exposure in milligrams per liter and milligram-years per liter, respectively. The indicated dose-response relationships were significant (P<<0.001) for both series of risk estimates. These results suggest that arsenic exposure may induce hypertension in humans.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved. Arsenic crosses the placenta and may have adverse consequences in utero and later in life. At present, little is known about arsenic concentrations in placenta and their relation to maternal and infant exposures particularly at common levels of exposure. We measured placenta arsenic in a US cohort potentially exposed via drinking water from private wells, and evaluated the relationships between placenta and maternal and infant biomarker arsenic concentrations. We measured total arsenic concentrations in placental samples from women enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (N=766). We compared these data to maternal urinary arsenic (total arsenic and individual species) collected at approximately 24-28 week gestation, along with maternal post-partum toenails and infant toenails using non-parametric multivariate analysis of log 10-transformed data. We also examined the association between placental arsenic and household drinking water arsenic. Placenta arsenic concentrations were related to arsenic concentrations in maternal urine ($\beta$ 0.55, P value {\textless} 0.0001), maternal ($\beta$ 0.30, P value 0.0196) and infant toenails ($\beta$ 0.40, P value 0.0293) and household drinking water ($\beta$ 0.09, P value {\textless} 0.0001). Thus, our data suggest that placenta arsenic concentrations reflect both maternal and infant exposures.},

	abstract = {Lead is an environmentally persistent toxin that causes neurological, hematological, gastrointestinal, reproductive, circulatory, and immunological pathologies. The propensity for lead to catalyze oxidative reactions and generate reactive oxygen species has been demonstrated in multiple studies. These reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibit the production of sulfhydryl antioxidants, inhibit enzyme reactions impairing heme production, cause inflammation in vascular endothelial cells, damage nucleic acids and inhibit DNA repair, and initiate lipid peroxidation in cellular membranes. These wide-ranging effects of ROS generation have been postulated to be major contributors to lead-exposure related disease. Antioxidants - vitamins B6, C and E, zinc, taurine, N-acetylcysteine, and alpha-lipoic acid, either alone or in conjunction with standard pharmaceutical chelating agents - have been studied in lead-exposed animals. The evidence for their use in lead exposure, alone and in conjunction with chelating agents, is reviewed in this article.},

When the inhabitants were divided into four groups according to the Cd concentration in rice or prevalence of abnormal urinary findings, significant relationships among three factors (Cd concentration in rice, prevalence of abnormal urinary findings and prevalence of patients with Itai-itai disease) were demonstrated clearly using the Cochran-Armitage test. Correlation coefficients among the three factors in 55 hamlets showed that the prevalence of the patients with Itai-itai disease increased according to increases in the mean Cd concentration in rice and increasing prevalence of urinary findings. This study demonstrated that Itai-itai disease is induced by exposure to environmental Cd and that renal dysfunction plays an important role in its development.},

	abstract = {Geophagia is defined as deliberate consumption of earths' materials, e.g. soil, clay and soft stones. The practice is widespread among pregnant women, and there are conflicting views as to whether it is beneficial to health or not. Geophagic materials may be a source of micronutrients though the materials may bind the micronutrients thus reducing or hindering their bioavailability in the body. Geophagia is closely associated with geohelminthic infections among pregnant women and heavy metal poisoning, which constitute significant public health problem in many developing countries such as Kenya. In our research, the geophagic materials consumed by the pregnant women were studied. A total of 38 geophagic materials in the possession by different pregnant women were analysed. The collected samples were subjected to standard digestion procedures and analysed for zinc, lead and iron by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Results indicated that the geophagic materials contained elevated levels of Fe at mean concentration value of 80.10 ppm, Pb at 3.28 ppm and Zn 1.81 ppm for a 1.00 g sample. An average of 20 g of the geophagic materials was being consumed per day. Based on the average consumption, the pregnant women were exposed to 65.52 ppm Pb per day, 36.2 ppm Zn per day and 1602 ppm Fe per day. Lead exceeded the WHO-lead exposure limits of 25 ppm/day for pregnant women. The materials were also subjected to microscopic examination for Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Taenia Spp., Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. In conclusion, the women were exposed to heavy metals-iron, zinc and lead, but there was no observable eggs, larvae or adult species of the geohelminths. The key recommendation was that there is need to integrate public health education on geophagia, lead screening and testing with antenatal support care systems. This will enhance maternal and child health, thus reducing infant and maternal morbidity and mortality rates.},

@article{Nordberg2004tz,
	abstract = {The first health effect of cadmium (Cd) was lung damage, reported in workers already in the 1930's, while bone effects and proteinuria were reported in the 1940's. After World War II, a bone disease with fractures and severe pain, the itai-itai disease, a form of Cd-induced renal osteomalacia, was identified in Japan. Subsequently, the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of Cd were described including its binding to the protein metallothionein. International warnings of health risks from cadmium pollution were issued in the 1970's. WHO, 1992, identified renal dysfunction as the critical effect and a crude quantitative evaluation was presented. In the 1990's population groups in China exposed to Cd via rice were studied and new information on skeletal, renal and reproductive toxicity of Cd was obtained in the ChinaCad project. There was a decrease in Bone Mineral Density (BMD), an increased prevalence of fractures and an increased urinary content of marker proteins of renal dysfunction among persons with long term exposure to Cd. The development of such biomarkers can be seen as a result of applied 'proteomics' research. Variation in metallothionein gene expression was related to development of renal dysfunction, supporting the usefulness of this 'genomic' approach. The ongoing rapid development of 'genomics' and 'proteomics' technologies will improve possibilities for molecular epidemiology studies in the future, providing an even better basis for preventive action. In many countries, Cd exposures are now under better control than in the past. The target for the 21st century is to achieve a totally acceptable exposure situation without adverse health effects from Cd.},

	abstract = {Ingestion of inorganic arsenic (iAs) is considered to be related to the development of diabetes mellitus. In order to clarify the possible differences in the metabolism in diabetics, we measured urinary iAs metabolites in diabetic cases and non-diabetic control subjects in Faridpur, an arsenic-contaminated area in Bangladesh. Physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetic cases (140 persons) and non-diabetic controls (180 persons) were recruited. Drinking water and spot urine samples were collected. Mean concentrations of total arsenic in drinking water did not differ between cases (85.1 Œºg/L) and controls (85.8 Œºg/L). The percentage of urinary iAs (iAs%) was significantly lower in cases (8.6%) than in controls (10.4%), while that of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA%) was higher in cases (82.6%) than in controls (79.9%). This may have been due to the higher secondary methylation index (SMI) in the former (11.6) rather than the latter (10.0). Adjusting for matching factors (sex and unions), and the additional other covariates (age and water arsenic) significantly attenuated the differences in iAs%, SMI, and DMA%, respectively, though the difference in monomethylarsonic acid% was newly significant in the latter adjustment. Our study did not suggest any significant differences in urinary arsenic metabolites between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent laboratory studies have suggested that cadmium is an estrogenic compound and may be a potential risk factor for breast cancer. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between urinary cadmium concentrations and serum concentrations of estrone, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in 164 postmenopausal Japanese women. RESULTS: There was a significant positive association between the urinary cadmium and serum testosterone levels after controlling for age and body mass index. The mean testosterone level was 28% higher in women with high urinary cadmium (> or = 3.00 microg/g creatinine) than in those with low urinary cadmium (< 2.00 microg/g creatinine). Urinary cadmium was not significantly associated with serum estrone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels. Additional adjustment for smoking, alcohol and reproductive factors including known risk factors for breast cancer did not substantially alter the results. CONCLUSION: Data suggested that cadmium exposure is associated with increased testosterone levels. As high testosterone levels have been associated with the risk of breast cancer, the involvement of cadmium exposure in breast cancer risk should be evaluated in future studies.},

@article{Meliker2010,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Arsenic in drinking water has been linked with the risk of urinary bladder cancer, but the dose-response relationships for arsenic exposures below 100 microg/L remain equivocal. We conducted a population-based case-control study in southeastern Michigan, USA, where approximately 230,000 people were exposed to arsenic concentrations between 10 and 100 microg/L. METHODS: This study included 411 bladder cancer cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2004, and 566 controls recruited during the same period. Individual lifetime exposure profiles were reconstructed, and residential water source histories, water consumption practices, and water arsenic measurements or modeled estimates were determined at all residences. Arsenic exposure was estimated for 99% of participants' person-years. RESULTS: Overall, an increase in bladder cancer risk was not found for time-weighted average lifetime arsenic exposure >10 microg/L when compared with a reference group exposed to <1 microg/L (odds ratio (OR) = 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65, 1.86). Among ever-smokers, risks from arsenic exposure >10 microg/L were similarly not elevated when compared to the reference group (OR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.50, 1.78). CONCLUSIONS: We did not find persuasive evidence of an association between low-level arsenic exposure and bladder cancer. Selecting the appropriate exposure metric needs to be thoughtfully considered when investigating risk from low-level arsenic exposure.},

We also attempted to identify which time period blood-lead concentrations are most predictive of adult outcome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We recruited adults in the Boston area who had participated as newborns and young children in a prospective cohort study that examined the relationship between lead exposure and childhood intellectual function. IQ was measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). The association between lead concentrations and IQ scores was examined using linear regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Forty-three adults participated in neuropsychological testing. Childhood blood-lead concentration (mean of the blood-lead concentrations at ages 4 and 10 years) had the strongest relationship with Full-Scale IQ ($\beta$ = -1.89 $\pm$ 0.70, p = 0.01). Full-scale IQ was also significantly related to blood-lead concentration at age 6 months ($\beta$ = -1.66 $\pm$ 0.75, p = 0.03), 4 years ($\beta$ = -0.90 $\pm$ 0.41, p = 0.03) and 10 years ($\beta$ = -1.95 $\pm$ 0.80, p = 0.02). Adjusting for maternal IQ altered the significance of the regression coefficient.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that lead exposure in childhood predicts intellectual functioning in young adulthood. Our results also suggest that school-age lead exposure may represent a period of increased susceptibility. Given the small sample size, however, the potentially confounding effects of maternal IQ cannot be excluded and should be evaluated in a larger study.},

	abstract = {The carcinogenic effect of arsenic is well documented, but epidemiologic data on liver cancer were limited. To evaluate the dose-response relationship between arsenic in drinking water and mortality of liver cancer, we conducted a study in 138 villages in the southwest coast area of Taiwan. We assessed arsenic levels in drinking water using data from a survey conducted by the government and reviewed death certificates from 1971 to 1990 to identify liver cancer cases. Using village as the unit, we conducted multi-variate regression analyses and then performed post hoc analyses to validate the findings. During the 20-year period, 802 male and 301 female mortality cases of liver cancer were identified. After adjusting for age, arsenic levels above 0.64 mg/L were associated with an increase in the liver cancer mortality in both genders, but no significant effect was observed for lower exposure categories. Post hoc analyses and a review of literature supported these findings. We concluded that exposures to high arsenic levels in drinking water are associated with the occurrence of liver cancer, but such an effect is not prominent at exposure levels lower than 0.64 mg/L.},

	abstract = {Background: Heavy metals are known to be harmful for neurodevelopment and they may correlate to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we aim to explore the relationships between multiple heavy metals (manganese, lead, cadmium, mercury, antimony, and bismuth), neurocognitive function, and ADHD symptoms. Methods: We recruited 29 patients with ADHD inattentive type (ADHD-I), 47 patients with ADHD hyperactivity/impulsivity type (ADHD-H/I), and 46 healthy control children. Urine samples were obtained to measure the levels of the aforementioned heavy metals in each child. Participants&rsquo; cognitive function and clinical symptoms were assessed, respectively. Results: We found ADHD-H/I patients demonstrated the highest antimony levels (p = 0.028), and ADHD-I patients demonstrated the highest cadmium levels (p = 0.034). Antimony levels were positively correlated with the severity of ADHD symptoms that were rated by teachers, and cadmium levels were negatively correlated with the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient. Lead levels were negatively correlated with most indices of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children‚ÅªFourth Edition (WISC-IV), but positively correlated with inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Lead, cadmium and antimony were associated with susceptibility to ADHD and symptom severity in school-age children. Eliminating exposure to heavy metals may help to prevent neurodevelopmental disorders in children.},

@article{Lee2002,
	abstract = {Arsenic in drinking water is a worldwide health problem that is associated with cardiovascular disease, but the cause is currently unknown. Arsenic effects on platelets, which are important in development of cardiovascular disease, were examined in vitro and in a drinking water study using a rat animal model. Trivalent inorganic arsenic (arsenite) induced in vitro aggregation when platelets were exposed to subthreshold challenge by thrombin and several other agonists in a concentration-dependent manner, with arsenite being the most potent form tested. Arsenite also induced significant increases in serotonin secretion, thromboxane A(2) formation, and adhesion protein expression in platelets. Consistent with the in vitro studies, 4-week ingestion of arsenite-contaminated drinking water resulted in enhanced arterial thrombosis. Human platelets showed similar responses, suggesting that the effects seen in animal experiments are applicable to humans. These results will provide new insights into the mechanism of arsenic-induced cardiovascular disease. They will also allow regulatory agencies to estimate risk from arsenic-induced cardiovascular disease and to determine if drinking water regulatory levels based on human cancer studies will protect against noncancer effects associated with cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {Cadmium, an environmental pollutant, can have adverse effects on the human body. The kidney is the critical organ. In order to improve the understanding of the dose-response relationship between cadmium exposure and health effects, and especially renal dysfunction, a study on a general population group in China was performed. This study was therefore concerned with cadmium exposure biomarkers, such as the concentrations in blood (BCd) and urine (UCd), and effect biomarkers of renal dysfunction, such as beta2-microglobulin (beta2m), retinol binding protein (RBP) and albumin (ALB). To improve the evaluation of exposure levels in relation to the adverse health effects of cadmium exposure in the general population, a quality control program was conducted to determine analytical quality in the determination of cadmium in blood and urine and for beta2m, creatinine, ALB and RBP. The measurements showed that analytical quality was adequate. The exposure and effect biomarkers were studied in the population groups living in three areas, namely a control area and two Cd polluted areas. In the highly exposed area, most of the BCd values were higher than 5 microg/l and most of the UCd values were higher than 5 microg/g creatinine. Beta2-microglobulin, retinol binding protein, and albumin in urine were all significantly higher in the population living in the heavily polluted area than in that in the control area. Based on data from all three areas, a marked dose-response relationship between UCd or BCd and the prevalence of renal dysfunction was demonstrated. The number of abnormalities in kidney was related to the level of cadmium exposure. Only one index of renal tubular dysfunction was affected in subjects exposed to low levels of cadmium, but more than two indices of renal function were affected in those exposed to high levels.},

@article{Jiang2007td,
	abstract = {Environmental exposure to some heavy metals such as cadmium appears to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, definite mechanism of their toxicity in AD remains to be elucidated. Previous studies largely focused on the metal ions binding to beta-amyloid, however, very few papers concerned the interaction between tau and metal ions. For the first time, we investigated the impacts of Cd(II) on the conformation and self-aggregation of Alzheimer's tau peptide R3, corresponding to the third repeat of microtubule-binding domain. The initial state of R3 was proven to be dimeric linked by intermolecular disulfide bond, in the non-reducing buffer (Tris-HCl buffer pH7.5, containing no reducing reagent). In this paper, we show that Cd(II) can accelerate heparin-induced aggregation of R3 or independently induce the aggregation of R3, as monitored by ThS fluorescence. In the presence of Cd(II), the resulting R3 filaments became much smaller, as revealed by electron microscopy. Binding to the Cd(II) ion, the dimeric R3 partially lost its random coil, and converted to alpha-helix structure, as revealed by CD and Raman spectrum. Stoichiometric analysis of CD signal against the ratio of [Cd(II)]/[R3] suggested that the coordination intermediate consisted of two R3 dimers binding to a central cadmium ion. As the seed, the coordination intermediate could extensively accelerate the self-aggregation of R3 via promoting the nucleation step. On the other hand, gain in alpha-helix structure on the peptide chain, by coordinating with Cd(II), could be a critical role to promote self-aggregation, as revealed by Raman spectrum. These results provide a further insight into the mechanism of tau filament formation and emphasize the possible involvement of Cd(II) in the pathogenesis of AD.},

	abstract = {Studies suggest that cadmium is associated with several clinical complications, primarily renal dysfunction and bone disease, but also some cancers. Cadmium toxicity has been associated with clinical manifestations at exposure levels that are well below the limits set by the World Health Organization. Here I review the OSCAR study, which demonstrates an association between environmental and occupational cadmium exposure and renal tubular damage, as well as the Cadmibel study, a cross-sectional population study demonstrating an association of cadmium exposure with renal dysfunction. The paper also reviews the association of end-stage renal disease prevalence with occupational and environmental exposure to cadmium in the Swedish population of Kalmar County. Renal tubular damage was shown to develop at levels of exposure much lower than previously thought. Cadmium-induced tubular proteinuria is irreversible, and continued exposure may lead to glomerular damage with decreased glomerular filtration rate. Itai-itai disease in the Jinzu river basin is discussed, as are the implications of low-level cadmium exposure in the PheeCad project. Cadmium accumulates in bone and is associated with osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Other bone-seeking trace elements, such as chromium, lanthanum, strontium and zinc, are of concern because of low level environmental, occupational or clinical exposure. As techniques are perfected for detecting smaller amounts of trace elements in various tissues in the body, investigators are finding that the threshold for toxicity from trace elements is much lower than expected. Further research on cadmium is necessary to reveal the mechanisms of toxicity and true environmental and occupational exposure limits.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although prenatal methylmercury exposure has been linked to poorer intellectual function in several studies, data from two major prospective, longitudinal studies yielded contradictory results. Associations with cognitive deficits were reported in a Faroe Islands cohort, but few were found in a study in the Seychelles Islands. It has been suggested that co-exposure to another contaminant, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), may be responsible for the positive findings in the former study and that co-exposure to nutrients in methylmercury-contaminated fish may have obscured and/or protected against adverse effects in the latter. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the degree to which co-exposure to PCBs may account for the adverse effects of methylmercury and the degree to which co-exposure to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may obscure these effects in a sample of Inuit children in Arctic Qu{\'e}bec. METHODS: IQ was estimated in 282 school-age children from whom umbilical cord blood samples had been obtained and analyzed for mercury and other environmental exposures. RESULTS: Prenatal mercury exposure was related to poorer estimated IQ after adjustment for potential confounding variables. The entry of DHA into the model significantly strengthened the association with mercury, supporting the hypothesis that beneficial effects from DHA intake can obscure adverse effects of mercury exposure. Children with cord mercury ‚â• 7.5 Œºg/L were four times as likely to have an IQ score < 80, the clinical cut-off for borderline intellectual disability. Co-exposure to PCBs did not alter the association of mercury with IQ. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to document an association of prenatal mercury exposure with poorer performance on a school-age assessment of IQ, a measure whose relevance for occupational success in adulthood is well established. This association was seen at levels in the range within which many U.S. children of Asian-American background are exposed.},

	abstract = {-Systematic research evaluating the separate and interacting impacts of neurotoxicants, micronutrients, and social environments on children's cognition and behavior has only recently been initiated. Years of extensive human epidemiologic and animal experimental research document the deleterious impact of lead and other metals on the nervous system. However, discrepancies among human studies and between animal and human studies underscore the importance of variations in child nutrition as well as social and behavioral aspects of children's environments that mitigate or exacerbate the effects of neurotoxicants. In this monograph, we review existing research on the impact of neurotoxic metals, nutrients, and social environments and interactions across the three domains. We examine the literature on lead, mercury, manganese, and cadmium in terms of dispersal, epidemiology, experimental animal studies, effects of social environments, and effects of nutrition. Research documenting the negative impact of lead on cognition and behavior influenced reductions by the Center for Disease Control in child lead-screening guidelines from 30 micrograms per deciliter (Œºg/dL) in 1975 to 25 Œºg/dL in 1985 and to 10 Œºg/dL in 1991. A further reduction is currently being considered. Experimental animal research documents lead's alteration of glutamate-neurotransmitter (particularly N-methyl-D-aspartate) activity vital to learning and memory. In addition, lead induces changes in cholinergic and dopaminergic activity. Elevated lead concentrations in the blood are more common among children living in poverty and there is some evidence that socioeconomic status influences associations between lead and child outcomes. Micronutrients that influence the effects of lead include iron and zinc. Research documenting the negative impact of mercury on children (as well as adults) has resulted in a reference dose (RfD) of 0.1 microgram per kilogram of body weight per day (Œºg/kg/day). In animal studies, mercury interferes with glutamatergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic activity. Although evidence for interactions of mercury with children's social contexts is minimal, researchers are examining interactions of mercury with several nutrients. Research on the effects of cadmium and manganese on child cognition and behavior is just beginning. Experimental animal research links cadmium to learning deficits, manganese to behaviors characteristic of Parkinson's disease, and both to altered dopaminergic functioning. We close our review with a discussion of policy implications, and we recommend interdisciplinary research that will enable us to bridge gaps within and across domains.},

Lungs are one of the main target organs for arsenic-related carcinogenesis. These tumors exhibit particular features, such as squamous cell-type specificity and high incidence among never smokers. Arsenic-induced malignant transformation is mainly related to the biotransformation process intended for the metabolic clearing of the carcinogen, which results in specific genetic and epigenetic alterations that ultimately affect key pathways in lung carcinogenesis. Based on this, lung tumors induced by arsenic exposure could be considered an additional subtype of lung cancer, especially in the case of never-smokers, where arsenic is a known etiological agent. In this article, we review the current knowledge on the various mechanisms of arsenic carcinogenicity and the specific roles of this metalloid in signaling pathways leading to lung cancer.},

@article{Hsu2002wc,
	abstract = {Lead-induced oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of lead poisoning for disrupting the delicate prooxidant/antioxidant balance that exists within mammalian cells. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is increased after lead treatment in in vitro studies. In vivo studies suggest that lead exposure causes generation of ROS and alteration of antioxidant defense systems in animals and occupationally exposed workers. The mechanisms for lead-induced oxidative stress include the effect of lead on membrane, DNA, and antioxidant defense systems of cells. From low to high doses of lead exposure, there are different responses of lead-induced oxidative stress in various target sites including lung, blood vessels, testes, sperm, liver, and brain in epidemiological as well as animal studies. Therefore, reducing the possibility of lead interacting with critical biomolecules and inducing oxidative damage, or bolstering the cell's antioxidant defenses might be associated with the beneficial role of antioxidant nutrients through exogenous supplementation of antioxidant molecules. Although many researchers have investigated the benefit of antioxidants in preventing lead toxicity, the mechanisms of antioxidant nutrients being effective via rebalancing the impaired prooxidant/antioxidant ratio are not completely clear. Antioxidant nutrients including, vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin B(6), beta-carotene, zinc, and selenium, are addressed in this review to discuss their beneficial role in lead-induced oxidative stress.},

@article{Hopenhayn2003,
	abstract = {Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (In-As) from drinking water is associated with different health effects, including skin, lung, bladder, and kidney cancer as well as vascular and possibly reproductive effects. In-As is metabolized through the process of methylation, resulting in the production and excretion of methylated species, mainly monomethylarsenate (MMA) and dimethylarsenate (DMA). Because a large percentage of the dose is excreted in urine, the distribution of urinary In-As, MMA, and DMA is considered a useful indicator of methylation patterns in human populations. Several factors affect these patterns, including sex and exposure level. In this study, we investigated the profile of urinary In-As, MMA, and DMA of pregnant women. Periodic urine samples were collected from early to late pregnancy among 29 pregnant women living in Antofagasta, Chile, who drank tap water containing 40 micro g/L In-As. The total urinary arsenic across four sampling periods increased with increasing weeks of gestation, from an initial mean value of 36.1 to a final value of 54.3 micro g/L. This increase was mainly due to an increase in DMA, resulting in lower percentages of In-As and MMA and a higher percentage of DMA. Our findings indicate that among women exposed to moderate arsenic from drinking water during pregnancy, changes occur in the pattern of urinary arsenic excretion and metabolite distribution. The toxicologic significance of this is not clear, given recent evidence suggesting that intermediate methylated species may be highly toxic. Nevertheless, this study suggests that arsenic metabolism changes throughout the course of pregnancy, which in turn may have toxicologic effects on the developing fetus. Key words: arsenic, arsenic metabolism, arsenic methylation, Chile, pregnancy, urinary arsenic.},

	abstract = {Mercury is a unique element that, unlike many metals, has no essential biological function. It is liquid at room temperature and is 13.6 times heavier than water. Its unique physical properties have been exploited for a variety of uses such as in mercury switches, thermostats, thermometers, and other instruments. Its ability to amalgamate with gold and silver are used in mining these precious metals and as a dental restorative. Its toxic properties have been exploited for medications, preservatives, antiseptics, and pesticides. For these reasons there have been many industrial uses of mercury, and occupational exposures of workers and industrial emissions and effluents contaminating air, water, soil, and ultimately food chains have long been a matter of great public health concern. This paper examines briefly six cases representing various forms of exposure to different species of mercury, and indicates the methodological issues in estimating exposure, bioavailability and absorption; these cases include Minamata disease in Japan, organic mercury poisoning in Iraq, methylmercury (MeHg) exposure in the Amazon, dimethylmercury (PMM) in the laboratory, an elemental mercury spill in Cajamarca, Peru, and a mercury-contaminated building in Hoboken, NJ, USA. Other scenarios that are not described include occupational exposure to mercury salts, mercurial preservatives in vaccines, cultural and ritualistic uses of mercury, and mercury in dental amalgams.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cadmium exposure has been inconsistently related to blood pressure. OBJECTIVES: We updated and reevaluated the evidence regarding the relationships of blood cadmium (BCd) and urine cadmium (UCd) with blood pressure (BP) and hypertension (HTN) in nonoccupationally exposed populations. DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: We searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles on BCd or UCd and BP or HTN in nonoccupationally exposed populations and extracted information from studies that provided sufficient data on population, smoking status, exposure, outcomes, and design. DATA SYNTHESIS: Twelve articles met inclusion criteria: eight provided data adequate for comparison, and five reported enough data for meta-analysis. Individual studies reported significant positive associations between BCd and systolic BP (SBP) among nonsmoking women [{\ss} = 3.14 mmHg per 1 Œºg/L untransformed BCd; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14-6.14] and among premenopausal women ({\ss} = 4.83 mmHg per 1 nmol/L log-transformed BCd; 95% CI, 0.17-9.49), and between BCd and diastolic BP (DBP) among women ({\ss} = 1.78 mmHg comparing BCd in the 90th and 10th percentiles; 95% CI, 0.64-2.92) and among premenopausal women ({\ss} = 3.84 mmHg per 1 nmol/L log-transformed BCd; 95% CI, 0.86-6.82). Three meta-analyses, each of three studies, showed positive associations between BCd and SBP (p = 0.006) and DBP (p < 0.001) among women, with minimal heterogeneity (I¬≤ = 3%), and a significant inverse association between UCd and HTN among men and women, with substantial heterogeneity (I¬≤ = 80%). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a positive association between BCd and BP among women; the results, however, are inconclusive because of the limited number of representative population-based studies of never-smokers. Associations between UCd and HTN suggest inverse relationships, but inconsistent outcome definitions limit interpretation. We believe a longitudinal study is merited.},

	abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that inorganic arsenic, a major environmental pollutant, exerts immunosuppressive effects in epidemiological, in vitro, and animal models. The mechanisms, however, remain unclear, and little is known about variation in susceptibilities due to age and sex. We performed a review of the experimental and epidemiologic evidence on the association of arsenic exposure and immune diseases. The majority of the studies described arsenic as a potent immunosuppressive compound, though others have reported an increase in allergy and autoimmune diseases, suggesting that arsenic may also act as an immune system stimulator, depending on the dose or timing of exposure. Limited information, due to either the high concentrations of arsenic used in in vitro studies or the use of non-human data for predicting human risks, is available from experimental studies. Moreover, although there is emerging evidence that health effects of arsenic manifest differently between men and women, we found limited information on sex differences on the immunotoxic effects of arsenic. In conclusion, preliminary data show that chronic early-life exposure to arsenic might impair immune responses, potentially leading to increased risk of infections and inflammatory-like diseases during childhood and in adulthood. Further investigation to evaluate effects of arsenic exposure on the developing immune system of both sexes, particularly in human cells and using concentrations relevant to human exposure, should be a research priority.},

Infants and young children are especially vulnerable to these toxic effects due to their immature development and high 'food intake/ body weight' ratio. Concerns have been raised by multiple independent studies that heavy metals have been found to be present in many foods in the infant and child food sector. Most recently, reports from the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy suggest subpar testing practices, lenient or absent standards, and limited oversight of food manufacturers perpetuate the presence of these contaminants in infant and toddler foods. The aim of this narrative review is to evaluate the current state of policies in the United States designed to safe-guard against excessive heavy metal exposure and to discuss what is presently known about the presence of the so-called heavy metals; arsenic, lead, mercury and cadmium found in infant and toddler foods. PubMed was used to search for studies published between 1999 and 2022 using a combination of search terms including: ``heavy metal,'' ``contamination,'' ``infant,'' ``toddler,'' and ``complementary food''.},

@article{Counter2004vl,
	abstract = {Exposure to toxic mercury (Hg) is a growing health hazard throughout the world today. Recent studies show that mercury exposure may occur in the environment, and increasingly in occupational and domestic settings. Children are particularly vulnerable to Hg intoxication, which may lead to impairment of the developing central nervous system, as well as pulmonary and nephrotic damage. Several sources of toxic Hg exposure in children have been reported in biomedical literature: (1) methylmercury, the most widespread source of Hg exposure, is most commonly the result of consumption of contaminated foods, primarily fish; (2) ethylmercury, which has been the subject of recent scientific inquiry in relation to the controversial pediatric vaccine preservative thimerosal; (3) elemental Hg vapor exposure through accidents and occupational and ritualistic practices; (4) inorganic Hg through the use of topical Hg-based skin creams and in infant teething powders; (5) metallic Hg in dental amalgams, which release Hg vapors, and Hg2+ in tissues. This review examines recent epidemiological studies of methylmercury exposure in children. Reports of elemental Hg vapor exposure in children through accidents and occupational practices, and the more recent observations of the increasing use of elemental Hg for magico-religious purposes in urban communities are also discussed. Studies of inorganic Hg exposure from the widespread use of topical beauty creams and teething powders, and fetal/neonatal Hg exposure from maternal dental amalgam fillings are reviewed. Considerable attention was given in this review to pediatric methylmercury exposure and neurodevelopment because it is the most thoroughly investigated Hg species. Each source of Hg exposure is reviewed in relation to specific pediatric health effects, particularly subtle neurodevelopmental disorders.},

@article{Concha1998,
	abstract = {Because of the lack of data on the exposure to and toxic effects of inorganic arsenic during early human development, the transfer of arsenic to the fetus and suckling infant was studied in a native Andean population, living in the village San Antonio de los Cobres in the North west of Argentina, where the drinking water contains about 200 micrograms/liter. The concentration of arsenic in cord blood (median, 9 micrograms/liter) was almost as high as in maternal blood (median, 11 micrograms/liter), and there was a significant correlation between the two. Thus, at least in late gestation, arsenic is easily transferred to the fetus. The median concentration of arsenic in the placenta was 34 micrograms/kg, compared with 7 micrograms/kg previously reported for nonexposed women. Interestingly, essentially all arsenic in the blood plasma of both the newborns and their mothers was in the form of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), the end product of inorganic arsenic metabolism. Similarly, about 90{\%} of the arsenic in the urine of both the newborns and mothers in late gestation was present as DMA, compared with about 70{\%} in nonpregnant women (p {\textless} 0.001). This may indicate that methylation of arsenic is increased during pregnancy and that DMA is the major form of arsenic transferred to the fetus. The increased methylation in late gestation was associated with lower arsenic concentrations in blood and higher concentrations in urine, compared with a few months postpartum. The arsenic concentrations in the urine of the infants decreased from about 80 micrograms/liter during the first 2 days of life to less than 30 micrograms/liter at 4.4 months (p = 0.025). This could be explained by the low concentrations of arsenic in the breast milk, about 3 micrograms/kg.},

@article{Carocci2014ts,
	abstract = {Mercury is among the most toxic heavy metals and has no known physiological role in humans. Three forms of mercury exist: elemental, inorganic and organic. Mercury has been used by man since ancient times. Among the earliest were the Chinese and Romans, who employed cinnabar (mercury sulfide) as a red dye in ink (Clarkson et al. 2007). Mercury has also been used to purify gold and silver minerals by forming amalgams. This is a hazardous practice, but is still widespread in Brazil's Amazon basin, in Laos and in Venezuela, where tens of thousands of miners are engaged in local mining activities to find and purify gold or silver. Mercury compounds were long used to treat syphilis and the element is still used as an antiseptic,as a medicinal preservative and as a fungicide. Dental amalgams, which contain about 50% mercury, have been used to repair dental caries in the U.S. since 1856.Mercury still exists in many common household products around the world.Examples are: thermometers, barometers, batteries, and light bulbs (Swain et al.2007). In small amounts, some organo mercury-compounds (e.g., ethylmercury tiosalicylate(thimerosal) and phenylmercury nitrate) are used as preservatives in some medicines and vaccines (Ballet al. 2001).Each mercury form has its own toxicity profile. Exposure to Hg0 vapor and MeHg produce symptoms in CNS, whereas, the kidney is the target organ when exposures to the mono- and di-valent salts of mercury (Hg+ and Hg++, respectively)occur. Chronic exposure to inorganic mercury produces stomatitis, erethism and tremors. Chronic MeHg exposure induced symptoms similar to those observed in ALS, such as the early onset of hind limb weakness (Johnson and Atchison 2009).Among the organic mercury compounds, MeHg is the most biologically available and toxic (Scheuhammer et a!. 2007). MeHg is neurotoxic, reaching high levels of accumulation in the CNS; it can impair physiological function by disrupting endocrine glands (Tan et a!. 2009).The most important mechanism by which mercury causes toxicity appears to bemitochondrial damage via depletion of GSH (Nicole et a!. 1998), coupled with binding to thiol groups ( -SH), which generates free radicals. Mercury has a high affinity for thiol groups ( -SH) and seleno groups ( -SeH) that are present in amino acids as cysteine and N-acetyl cysteine, lipoic acid, proteins, and enzymes. N-acetylcysteine and cysteine are precursors for the biosynthesis of GSH, which is among the most powerful intracellular antioxidants available to protect against oxidative stress and inflammation.Mercury and methylmercury induce mitochondrial dysfunction, which reduces ATP synthesis and increases lipid, protein and DNA peroxidation. The content of metallothioneines, GSH, selenium and fish high in omega-3 fatty acids appear to be strongly related with degree of inorganic and organic mercury toxicity, and with the protective detoxifying mechanisms in humans. In conclusion, depletion of GSH,breakage of mitochondria, increased lipid peroxidation, and oxidation of proteins and DNA in the brain, induced by mercury and his salts, appear to be important factors in conditions such as ALS and AD (Bains and Shaw 1997; Nicole eta!. 1998;Spencer eta!. 1998; Alberti et a!. 1999).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growing attention has been paid in recent decades to the effects on male reproduction of occupational exposures to toxic agents. There is strong evidence that high level exposure to lead, i. e. blood lead level (PbB) > 70 microg/dl, is associated with male infertility and some reports suggest an effect even at lower PbB (i. e. < 50 microg/dl). The aim of this study is to shed more light on the postulated association between occupational exposure to relatively low levels of inorganic lead and reduced fertility in men estimated by the length of time taken to conceive: time to pregnancy (TTP). METHODS: A survival analysis of TTP of the last pregnancy was performed adopting the Kaplan Meier methodology. The target population included 782 lead-exposed workers and 165 controls. 251 lead workers and 119 controls were finally eligible and interviewed. Lead-exposed subjects were distributed into four exposure levels according to their blood lead concentration (i.e. < 20; 20-29; 30-39, and >/= 40 microg/dl). The Cox model was adopted to estimate the Relative Risk of unsuccessful waiting time to pregnancy associated to the exposure to lead. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in fecundability (shorter TTP) in favor of exposed subjects was detected. Nevertheless, longer TTP was associated within the exposed group to higher levels of PbB, even though the gradient is not statistically significant. The exposed workers revealed an average number of children larger than those not exposed, and a clear gradient of the same variable was evident from the lowest to the highest PbB level. Focusing on subjects with one child only, the Cox model confirmed no significant difference in fecundability between exposed and not exposed, whereas a statistically significant longer TTP was associated to the exposure level >/= 40 microg/dl. CONCLUSIONS: It is not easy to assert or to deny the effect of inorganic lead on male fecundity, quantitatively estimated by TTP, with the data available for this study. In fact, while the general data seem to exclude effects of Pb on male fecundability a more detailed analysis suggests an unfavorable effect at relatively high levels of exposure but some confounding attributable to personal and social conditions of the workers cannot be ruled out. Further investigations with a better control of confounding are needed.},

	abstract = {Human exposure to mercury is still a major public health concern. In this context, children have a higher susceptibility to adverse neurological mercury effects, compared to adults with similar exposures. Moreover, there exists a marked variability of personal response to detrimental mercury action, in particular among population groups with significant mercury exposure. New scientific evidence on genetic backgrounds has raised the issue of whether candidate susceptibility genes can make certain individuals more or less vulnerable to mercury toxicity. In this review, the aim is to evaluate a new genetic dimension and its involvement in mercury risk assessment, focusing on the important role played by relevant polymorphisms, located in attractive gene targets for mercury toxicity. Existing original articles on epidemiologic research which report a direct link between the genetic basis of personal vulnerability and different mercury repercussions on human health will be reviewed. Based on this evidence, a careful evaluation of the significant markers of susceptibility will be suggested, in order to obtain a powerful positive "feedback" to improve the quality of life. Large consortia of studies with clear phenotypic assessments will help clarify the "window of susceptibility" in the human health risks due to mercury exposure.},

@article{Signes2021,
	abstract = {Lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and fluoride (F) exposure during childhood is of concern owing to their toxicity. Also, evidence suggests that high and low exposure levels to manganese (Mn) and selenium (Se) during this vulnerable period are associated with an increased risk of adverse health effects. A reduced growth is associated with high Pb and F exposure; however, little is known about their impact on children's body size, and there is a lack of consensus on the effects of Hg, Mn, and Se exposure on children's anthropometric measures. This is particularly true for childhood metal co-exposures at levels relevant to the general population. We investigated the joint effects of exposure to a metal mixture (Pb, Mn, Hg, and Se in blood and F in plasma) on 6--11-year-old US children's anthropometry (n = 1634). Median F, Pb, Mn, Hg, and Se concentrations were 0.3 ¬µmol/L, 0.5 ¬µg/dL, 10.2 ¬µg/L, 0.3 ¬µg/L, and 178.0 ¬µg/L, respectively. The joint effects of the five metals were modeled using Bayesian kernel machine and linear regressions. Pb and Mn showed opposite directions of associations with all outcome measured, where Pb was inversely associated with anthropometry. For body mass index and waist circumference, the effect estimates for Pb and Mn appeared stronger at high and low concentrations of the other metals of the mixture, respectively. Our findings suggest that metal co-exposures may influence children's body mass and linear growth indicators, and that such relations may differ by the exposure levels of the components of the metal mixture.},

Microbiological risk analysis is a process consisting of three components: Risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication, which has the overall objective to ensure public health protection. This document deals with risk assessment which is a key element in assuring that sound science is used to establish standards, guidelines and other recommendations for food safety to enhance consumer protection and facilitate international trade. The microbiological risk assessment process should include quantitative information to the greatest extent possible in the estimation of risk. A microbiological risk assessment should be conducted using a structured approach such as that described in this document. This document will be of primary interest to governments although other organizations, companies, and other interested parties who need to prepare a microbiological risk assessment will find it valuable. Since microbiological risk assessment is a developing science, implementation of these guidelines may require a period of time and may also require specialized training in the countries that consider it necessary. This may be particularly the case for developing countries. Although microbiological risk assessment is the primary focus of this document, the method can also be applied to certain other classes of biological hazards},

We described chemical-related information collected by ECHO cohorts and reviewed ECHO-relevant literature on exposure routes, sources, and environmental and human monitoring. Fifty-six ECHO cohorts have existing or planned chemical biomonitoring data for mothers or children. Environmental phenols/parabens, phthalates, metals/metalloids, and tobacco biomarkers are each being measured by ‚â•15 cohorts, predominantly during pregnancy and childhood, indicating ample opportunities to study child health outcomes. Cohorts are collecting questionnaire data on multiple exposure sources and conducting environmental monitoring including air, dust, and water sample collection that could be used for exposure assessment studies. To supplement existing chemical data, we recommend biomonitoring of emerging chemicals, nontargeted analysis to identify novel chemicals, and expanded measurement of chemicals in alternative biological matrices and dust samples. ECHO's rich data and samples represent an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate environmental chemical research to improve the health of US children.},
