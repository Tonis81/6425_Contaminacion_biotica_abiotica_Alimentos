Methods,Advantages,LimitationsInductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES),Low limit of detection: 0.01 - 10 ppb,Unsuitable for the analysis of Group 1 metals,Dynamic range about five orders of magnitude,Inter_element interferences (appropriate corrective measures should be adopted),The use of a polychromator allows the determination of about 60 elements in a few minutes,Ambient temperature and humidity need to be monitored,,High cost of analysisInductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) ,Simultaneous analysis of one or many elements,High cost of instrumentation,Analysis of most elements,Reduction or elimination of matrix effects is necessary,Low limit of detection: 0.01 - 10 ppb,Samples with a complex matrix have to be solubilized,Wide dynamic range,Acids of very high purity have to be used,Excellent sensitivity and selectivity,,Analysis is quick and straightforward,Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA),High selectivity and sensitivity,Labour intensive,Very large dynamic range,"Some important elements (e.g., Pb) cannot be determined",Very good precision and accuracy,Time-consuming,Suitable for the determination of 60 - 70 elements ,High investment costs,,The necessity of a nuclear reactor for irradiationX-ray fluorescence methods (XRF) ,Non-destructive in principle and multi-element,High self-absorption of emitted radiation limiting the analysis to thin films or surface layers,Good selectivity,Dependence on particle size and homogeneity,High sample throughput,Strong matrix effects demanding exact matching of samples and standards,"Low cost, easy operation",Conventional XRF is generally not sensitive enough for background determinations in various environmental matricesFlame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (FAAS),Relatively inexpensive and easy to use,Relatively low sensitivity,Ideal for analyzing a single element in a given sample,Narrow linear working range,"Less time-consuming and less sensitive to interfer ence effects (e.g., from background absorbance) than GFAAS",The use of potentially dangerous fuel gas,,Limitations on multielement analysisGraphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GF-AAS),Detection limit is better than FAAS and better than ICP-OES for some elements,"With the added cost of the graphite furnace, it some what negates the cost advantage of AAS","High sensitivity, more sensitive than FAAS",Lower sample throughput,"It can accommodate smaller samples than are required
for FAAS",More difficult operation and lower precision,Determines elements from various matrices ,Higher matrix interferencesCold Vapor Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (CV-AAS) ,Higher sensitivity in comparison to conventional FAAS,Limited to mercury determination,Best technique for mercury analysis,Hydride generation Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (HG-AAS),Low detection limits in the presence of high sampling efficiency,"Accuracy dependent on analyte valence state, reaction time",,Restricted to analysis of specific elements
